*By: AJ Savino*

Pronto is an ActionScript 3 framework that provides simple solutions to common Flash needs such as playing videos, service requests, view management, and audio management.

Pronto is built on a ui component architecture that unifies a common api between components while providing optimizations. The *Moxie Video Player* is the perfect solution for all video needs. It provides a wide array of controls that are easily skinable, self-contained, and require no coding to use. The View Management, Audio Management, and Service Request classes provide a solid foundation to any project.
